[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-Now-brightgreen)](https://github.com/Shivvvanshh/Command-Line-To-Do-Manager-Python-/releases)

## 📖 Overview

The Command-Line To-Do Manager is a simple and effective solution to manage your tasks. This application allows you to create, view, complete, and delete tasks easily through a command-line interface. It stores your tasks in a JSON file, making it straightforward to edit and track your progress. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to download and run the application:

1. **Check System Requirements**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your computer. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/). 

2. **Visit the Download Page**  
   Go to the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Shivvvanshh/Command-Line-To-Do-Manager-Python-/releases) to download the application.

## 🔧 Download & Install

1. Click on the link above to visit the releases page.
2. Look for the latest version of the software.
3. Download the appropriate file for your operating system. It may be labeled `Commmand-Line-To-Do-Manager-Python.zip` or another relevant name based on the version.
4. Unzip the file to a folder of your choice.

## ⚙️ Running the Application

1. Open a command-line interface (like Command Prompt for Windows or Terminal for macOS/Linux).
2. Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the application using the `cd` command. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path_to_your_folder
   ```
3. Run the application by typing:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   Replace `main.py` with the actual name of the main Python file if it's different.

## 📥 Using the To-Do Manager

After running the application, you can manage your tasks using the following commands:

- **Add Task**  
  When prompted, enter the title of the task you want to add. For example, "Buy groceries".

- **Show Tasks**  
  The application will display all your tasks along with their completion status. Tasks that are done will be checked (✔), while those still pending will be marked as not done (✘).

- **Complete Task**  
  To mark a task as complete, enter the number corresponding to that task. For instance, if you want to complete the first task, simply type `1`.

- **Delete Task**  
  To remove a task, first show the tasks, then enter the number of the task you wish to delete.

## 📂 Task Data Storage

Your tasks are saved in a file named `tasks.json`. You can find this file in the same folder where you ran the application. If you need to, you can open this file with a text editor to view or modify your tasks directly.

## 🔒 Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Python Not Installed**  
   If you see an error saying 'python' is not recognized, ensure Python is installed correctly and added to your system's PATH.

2. **File Errors**  
   If you encounter issues related to `tasks.json`, make sure the file is in the correct directory (the same as your application).

3. **Invalid Task Number**  
   Enter a valid task number when marking a task as complete or deleting a task. Verify the task list if you're unsure.

## 🌍 Future Features

While this application serves its purpose well, future updates may include:

- Task Prioritization: Assign levels of priority to each task.
- Due Dates: Set deadlines for tasks and receive reminders.
- User Profiles: Allow users to create multiple task lists.

Your feedback can help improve the application. Share any ideas or issues you encounter.
